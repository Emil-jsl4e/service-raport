# Service-raport

Hi, my name is Emil, this is my application: My application is responsible for managing the machine service. 
I have a module warehouse with parts  (adding, downloading, updating, deleting). 
Authorization with logging in, adding a user, logging out, and downloading logged-in user data and adding orders,
updating orders, adding service technicians to the order. In the future, I want to expand it with subsequent modules for reporting after repair,
work lists, and parts.

This shows my actual programming skills in nestjs and mysql.
